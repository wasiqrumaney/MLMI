Alessandro:
- Encountered problems at 32-vert, went back to 16-back, got good results, found out few problems with previous implementation
- Obtained promising results for 32-vert
- Tried Dice Loss -> Good, using this going forward
- Tweaking visualization functions to show results


Abdelrahman:
- After suspecting the distribution of 3D-Minist and not being able to produce results using WGAN-GP, i moved to the vertebra dataset. 
- Exploring and preprocessing the Vertebra dataset (using parts of a code written by Alessandro)
- Modifying the existing archeticture and finally got generation results for Vertebrae on 16 cube level.
