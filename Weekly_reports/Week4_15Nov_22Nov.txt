Alessandro:

-Upload 3D-MNIST 16 results
-Upload 3D-MNIST 64 proposed network (unable to train it)

Abdelrahman:
- More trials on to stabilizing the training for vanilla GAN (one  and two sided label smoothing, label flipping, noisy labels, more training for discriminator, etc)
- Vanilla GAN for 16 cube 3DMnist seemed to be working and producing some good results
- More literature on to WSGAN and WSGAN-GP objective function to improve the Vanilla Model for 3dMnist 
- Introducing the visdom interactive plotting approach for better visualizing the 3dData and dumping the old plotting method.

Wasiq:
- Upload WGAN-GP
- Reading literature on Latent Space Vectorisation for GANs
- Following SimpleITK

Sweety:
-Scripts of LSV for 2D MNIST
(confusion reagrding DL libraries)
-Resrearch on DL
