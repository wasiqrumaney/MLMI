Alessandro: 

- Reading basics of GANs and VAEs
- Reading basics of SimpleITK
- Proposed implemention of pre-processing (resampling, extracting vertabrae, resizing)
- Uploaded a basic VAE implementation for MNIST


Abdelrahman:

- Ramping up in GANs and VAEs.
- Ramping up in SimpleITK and ITK. 
- Writing Basic code to read a scan, Iso-Resample, crop,resize it. (The code was dumped in favor of Alessandro's code). 
- Building a pytorch framework to preprocess the whole dataset. 


Wasiq: 
- Reading literature on GANs and VAEs in Project description paper
- Reading basics of SimpleITK
- Training and uploading a simple GAN model for MNIST

Sweety:
- Reading basics of GANs and VAEs
