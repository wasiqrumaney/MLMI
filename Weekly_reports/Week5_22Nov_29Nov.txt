Alessandro:

Switch to work on vertebrae 32
- Proposed visualization and data processing utilities
- Proposed VAE for 32-voxel implementation
- Uploaded Vertabrae-32 preliminary experiment

Abdelrahman:
- Trying the 64 cube implementation for the 3Dminst (a big failure due to lack of GPU resources) 
- My machine is broken, so moved completely to Co-lab, prepared the environment, and setup a template to plug in the model and data and smoothly running the code from anywhere
- Using different utilities to pickle, load the model from different checkpoints, also logging the model losses. 
- Implementing the WSGAN-GP objective for the 16 cube 3dMnist model, hoping for a more stable GAN
- Busting my brain off trying to stabilize the WSGAN model, debgging the code, searching for different tricks, trials to change the architecture but no good output eventually (SAD week) 


Wasiq:
- Reading literature on Progressively Growing GANs
# https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05776 (discuss with mentor in the next meeting)

Sweety:

-DL library confusions setteled
-looking for 
1. colormap based on probs output for visualization
2. matplotlib3d voxels visualization
